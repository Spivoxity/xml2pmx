to implement --help, etc.

    support.c
    xmain.c

The bytecode interpreter is from release 3.1.0 of OBC, and rebuilding
of the bytecode file, if necessary, must be done with the same release
-- bytecode is not portable between releases because the opcodes
change.  Alternatively, update the source files here from a later
release.

TODO: configuration process for multiple platforms.  The setup in
config.h is conservative and mostly suits most platforms -- I've
avoided dynamic libraries, FFI, etc.  The main point of difference
will be the storage allocator, which must find storage in the bottom
4GB of the address space on a 64-bit host.  Solutions for 64 bit
Linux, Windows and Mac are included.  BSD should work with MAP_32BIT also,
but I haven't tested it.
